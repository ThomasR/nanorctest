=====

Test your nanorc files online, without starting nano over and over again.

###  http://thomasr.github.io/nanorctest/

## What is this?

This is a tool to test [nano](http://www.nano-editor.org/) syntax highlighting definitions online.

If you've ever written one, you know that there's a lot of trial and error involved. Itâ€™s a real pain to restart nano over and over just to see your changes. So try your changes in the browser first, and see the effect instantly!

## Where can I get more nano syntax definitions?

[Here](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc).
